# Happy thoughts Project

Task: Fetching and posting data to an API using useState and useEffect. 

### The Problem

I started by creating the components and adding some basic styling.
I started by fetching the thoughts from the API for the feed, then added the form to post a thought to the API. 
I struggled with making the like button work and ading another like. I have a separate component for the button and feel like it could have been easier if I just integrated it into the feed. 

I googled quite a bit to make the timestamp work (xx days ago), but found a function that works. Decided against moment.js because it's a legacy project.
